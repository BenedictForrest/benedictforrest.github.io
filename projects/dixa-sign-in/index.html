              Improving the Dixa login screen for it's users. And if it happens
              to benefit us too, who's complaining?
            </h1>
            <p>
              When thinking about ways to improve the Dixa web app our focus
              went to some of out most important features first. We'd think of
              things like adding more data to the Dashboard, making more
              messages visible at once in the Conversation screen, refreshing
              the look and feel of the UI.
            </p>
            <p>
              But there was one part of the app, a very important part of the
              app, that users interacted with every day that we were
              overlooking. A part of the app so important that if it stopped
              working no other feature on the app could be accessed. A part of
              the app staring us in the face nearly every day and yet somehow
              completely forgotten about.

            <h2>The sign in screen, duh!</h2>
            <p>
              The sign in screen has facilitated hundreds of users signing in to
              use Dixa at least once a week for many years. We should probably
              have started a countdown to our one millionth sign in so we could
              send the lucky user one of those giant, novelty cheques to
              celebrate.
            </p>
            <p>
              But just because users weren't sending us angry emails every other
              day to complain about it, doesn't mean it didn't need
              improvements. Taking a quick look at the original sign in screen,
              there's nothing horribly wrong with it. But let's take a closer
              look...

              Now, can I tell when a gap is 7px when it should be 8px with the
              naked eye? Maybe... so developers be forewarned if you submit a
              ticket for a design review. But if/when the naked eye fails, dev
              tools pick up the slack. After reviewing the sign in screen in the
              browser dev tools I found a lot off off-system values being used
              for things like font sizes, colours, and gaps.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also discovered areas that needed improvement in off-tone
              language, a confusing mix up of terminology, and missing
              accessibility features like placeholder text for inputs. All
              little things that can be easily fixed now that we were of them.
              With those details out of the way we could start making some real
              juicy improvements to the way the sign in process works.

            <h2>What is the right way to sign in?</h2>
            <p>
              To sign in to Dixa you entered just your email, and a ‚Äúmagic link‚Äù
              would be sent to your inbox. While this was a convenient and
              secure way to sign in, it did have it's drawbacks. Sometimes
              emails can be slow to arrive, or they might go into a Spam folder.
              And if a user for some reason lost access to their email that
              means they lost access to Dixa too.

            <p>
              I worked with our Customer Success team to identify what other
              types of authentication methods are customers were familiar with
              and would like to use to access Dixa. Then I worked with the
              Development team to create the many variations of the UI we would
              need.

            <h2>Listening to all of our users</h2>
            <p>
              Paying attention to user feedback is critical in the product
              development cycle. We gathered it through customer satisfaction
              reviews, social media comments, and in-person and virtual client
              meetings. But there's another important place I go to get
              invaluable feedback: the QA team!
            </p>
            <p>
              Yes, the QA testers use the product more than anyone on the team,
              and they were signing in upwards of a dozen times a day, as a part
              of testing bug patches and feature releases. And a unique problem
              they were running into was not being able to easily tell one
              client's sign in subdomain from another, as they often had
              multiple open at once.
            </p>
            <p>
              To address this issue I added the company's logo and name to the
              sign in screen, which only appear on their unique subdomain,
              rapha.dixa.com for example. While this change was mainly aimed at
              improving our experience, it would go on to help our bigger
              clients who had multi-domain customer support accounts.

            <p>
              John Wooden, and American basketball coach said ‚ÄúIt's the little
              details that are vital. Little things make big things happen.‚Äù
              That's what this project was about, the little things. You don't
              need to do a complete redesign of your application to make it feel
              fresh. You don't need to rebuild your codebase from the group up
              to make it faster, but it might help.
            </p>
            <p>
              By making small adjustments, like ensuring adherence to the design
              system tokens and writing style guide through design reviews;
              making signing in quicker and more accessible through new
              authentication methods; we made a meaningful improvement to the
              usability of our app.
